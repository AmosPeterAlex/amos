My journey began with a B.Tech in Electronics & Communication Engineering from A.P.J Abdul Kalam Technological University, and I've since dedicated myself to mastering cross-platform development.</p>",
      "<p>Currently working at <strong>Nexteons LLP</strong>, I specialize in developing scalable ERP systems using Flutter, Dart, and GraphQL. I've optimized API performance from 3 seconds to under 500ms, implemented CI/CD pipelines, and built interactive dashboards that serve real business needs.</p>",
      "<p>My approach centers on <strong>clean architecture</strong>, maintainable code, and user-centric design. Whether it's mobile, web, or desktop, I focus on creating seamless experiences that solve real problems. I'm particularly skilled in state management patterns (GetX, Provider, BLoC), backend integration (GraphQL, REST), and performance optimization.</p>",
      "<p>Beyond coding, I value continuous learning, effective communication, and collaborative problem-solving. I'm always exploring new Flutter capabilities and best practices to deliver better solutions.</p>"
